# blackjack.cs
terminal-based blackjack written in csharp
the game rules are probably not perfectly defined, however the point of this was to write&learn the C# code, not to perfectly implement the rules of a card game

.cs is written purely in csharp, comments added to describe the logic behind some used methods

.exe should work out of the box on windows, on linux one will need a .net framework, such as mono-project

have fun
